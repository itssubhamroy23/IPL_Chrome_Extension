# IPL_Chrome_Extension

The design of this list card is meant to be clean and modern, with a focus on simplicity and functionality. The use of a flat white background and shadow effects creates depth and contrast, drawing the user's eye to each individual card.

The use of a contrasting orange color for the border and hover effects adds a pop of color that is eye-catching without being overwhelming. 

This is the Screenshot of the Extension.

When a user hovers over any card, the card enlarges slightly and a subtle orange border appears at the bottom of the card.
